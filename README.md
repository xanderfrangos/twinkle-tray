Twinkle Tray lets you easily manage the brightness levels of multiple monitors. Even though Windows is capable of adjusting the backlight on most monitors, it typically doesn't support external monitors. Windows 10 & 11 also lack any ability to manage the brightness of multiple displays. This app inserts a new icon into your system tray, where you can click to have instant access to the brightness levels of all compatible displays.

## Compatibility
Twinkle Tray uses DDC/CI and WMI to communicate with your monitors. Most monitors offer DDC/CI compatibility, but it may be off by default. Make sure you have the appropriate option(s) enabled on your monitor so that it can work with Twinkle Tray. Refer to your monitor's user manual for more information.

**Known issues:**
- The AMD Radeon Control Panel can interfere with Twinkle Tray. Ensure "Custom Colors" is not enabled.
- VGA may not be compatible.
- USB/Thunderbolt/Surface docks with HDMI or DisplayPort may not be compatible. 
- DDC/CI features such as brightness control and power state may cause certain models of monitors to behave poorly. This applies to any DDC/CI software, not just Twinkle Tray.

If some of your monitors are not being detected, please see [this page](https://github.com/xanderfrangos/twinkle-tray/wiki/Display-Detection-&-Support-Issues) for troubleshooting steps.

## Command Line Arguments

Twinkle Tray (v1.13.0+) supports requesting brightness changes from the command line. Twinkle Tray must already be running. One monitor argument and one brightness argument are required. Multiple arguments will override each other.

For example: `"%LocalAppData%\Programs\twinkle-tray\Twinkle Tray.exe" --MonitorNum=1 --Offset=-30` will adjust monitor number 1 by -30 brightness.

### Supported args:

- `--List` List all displays. *(available in v1.14.0+)*
- `--MonitorNum` Select monitor by number. Starts at 1. *Example: `--MonitorNum=2`*
- `--MonitorID` Select monitor by internal ID. Partial or whole matches accepted. *Example: `--MonitorID="UID2353"`*
- `--All` Flag to select all monitors.
- `--Set` Set brightness percentage. *Example: `--Set=95`*
- `--Offset` Adjust brightness percentage. *Example: `--Offset=-20`*
